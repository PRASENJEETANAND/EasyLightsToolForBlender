# Easy Light Tool for Blender

The **Easy Light Tool** is a Blender add-on designed to simplify the process of managing light groups in your scene. This tool automates light group assignments, ensures missing AOVs are created, and provides intuitive controls for managing light attributes. Additionally, it helps resolve naming issues by replacing dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`) to ensure compatibility with Blender’s light group system.
